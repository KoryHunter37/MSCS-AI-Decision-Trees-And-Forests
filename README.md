# MSCS Project

This repository overviews an Artificial Intelligence design project which I completed while completing my Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. The source code for this project is not publically available, in compliance with the Georgia Institute of Technology Academic Honor Code<sup><a href="https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/academic-honor-code">[1]</a></sup>.

Instead, I have substituted my raw code with a guided walkthrough of the project itself, the steps I went through to complete it, and the skills I acquired by solving it.

# Overview

Machine learning offers a number of methods for classifying data into discrete categories, such as k-means clustering<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">[2]</a></sup>. Decision trees<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">[3]</a></sup> provide a structure for such categorization, based on a series of decisions that led to separate distinct outcomes.

In this assignment, I worked with decision trees to perform binary classification according to some decision boundary. I built and then trained decision trees which were capable of solving useful classification problems. Finally, I implemented strategies to measure their performance.
